#Stay or Stray: Predicting Online Course Dropout

##About the Project
In the rapidly evolving landscape of online education, understanding student engagement and retention has never been more important. "Stay or Stray: Predicting Online Course Dropout" is a data science initiative aimed at tackling the challenge of predicting student dropouts in online courses. This project leverages machine learning to analyze early interactions and engagement patterns, identifying at-risk students before they disengage. By predicting dropout likelihoods, educational institutions and course providers can implement targeted interventions to improve student retention.

##Project Objectives

##Predictive Analysis: Utilize historical data on student engagement, course interaction, and completion rates to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast student dropouts.
##Feature Engineering: Explore and engineer features from raw data capturing various aspects of student behavior and course interaction patterns.
##Intervention Strategies: Provide actionable insights that can inform strategies to enhance student engagement and reduce dropout rates.

##Data
The project uses a comprehensive dataset provided by the Data Science Hub, Northeastern University, containing anonymized information about student enrollments, activity logs, and engagement metrics within online courses. Features include login frequency, assignment completion rates, content type preferences, and more.

##Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct a thorough analysis to understand data distributions, identify patterns, and detect outliers.
Preprocessing: Implement data cleaning, handling of missing values, and normalization to prepare the dataset for modeling.
Feature Engineering: Derive new features that capture essential aspects of student engagement and course interactions.
Model Development: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms to develop a model that provides the best predictive performance.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics such as the F1-score, ensuring the model's effectiveness in predicting student dropouts.

##Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language for data processing and modeling.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development and evaluation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
